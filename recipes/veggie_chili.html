    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  
    <ul>
        <li> 2 Poblano chilis</li>
        <li> 2 Green peppers</li>
        <li> 2 Red peppers</li>
        <li> 1 Large onion</li>
        <li> 3 Cloves garlic</li>
        <li> 1.5 Cups Flour</li>
        <li> 1 16oz can of kidney beans</li>
        <li> 1 Can of chipotle peppers in adobo</li>
        <li> 2 16oz cans of peeled whole tomatoes</li>
        <li> 2 8oz cans of white beans</li>
        <li> 1 80z can of corn</li>
        <li> Ground chipotle pepper (if you can't find, cayenne works as well)</li>
        <li> Ground chili pepper</li>
        <li> Ground cumin</li>
        <li> Dried oregano (preferably Mexican) </li>
        <li> Olive oil </li>
        <li> Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> (Ahead of time) Brush oil on poblano peppers and broil until charred on all sides. Place in baggy in refrigerator</li>
        <li> Remove charred skin and seeds from poblanos</li>
        <li> Slice garlic as thin as you can do safely</li>
        <li> Dice the rest of the vegetables including the poblanos</li>
        <li> Put enough oil in the pan to cover the bottom, add garlic and heat until the garlic is just starting to tan. It should smell toasty and fragrant </li>
        <li> Turn heat up and add onions and peppers. Keep the heat up and stir as needed to prevent burning. You're done when the vegetables are browning and the moisture has left them. Add salt to taste </li>
        <li> In between stirring blend the tomatoes and 2 of the chilis in adobo</li>
        <li> When the veggies have the moisture removed and are starting to brown turn the heat to max and dump the blended tomatoes and chilis in</li>
        <li> Boil the liguid until the oil is absorded into the sauce, stiring occasionally to prevent sticking on the bottom of the pan</li>
        <li> While you are boiling the sauce, add in salt chili powders, cumin and oregano to taste. I use about 1/3 cup chili powder, 2 T cumin, 2 t oregano and 1 t ground chipotle </li>
        <li> Once the oil is absorded and the flavor is good, add in the beans and corn. You can add some of the bean juice from the can to thicken if you want.</li>
        <li> Heat through and give it a final taste. If its flat a little lemon juice or a touch of sugar can help. Enjoy!</li>

    </ol>
